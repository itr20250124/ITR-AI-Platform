# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing automated unit testing with error detection and fixing capabilities for the multi-AI platform. The system should be able to run tests, identify failures, and automatically apply fixes to common testing issues while maintaining code quality and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run unit tests automatically and have common errors fixed, so that I can maintain code quality without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL identify all failing tests and categorize error types
2. WHEN test failures are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically fix common configuration issues
3. WHEN test failures involve missing mocks THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate mock implementations
4. WHEN test failures involve incorrect assertions THEN the system SHALL suggest or apply corrected assertions
5. IF test failures cannot be automatically fixed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all components, so that I can ensure system reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running test coverage analysis THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for all components
2. WHEN new components are added THEN the system SHALL automatically generate basic test templates
3. WHEN API services are tested THEN the system SHALL include proper mocking and error handling tests
4. WHEN React components are tested THEN the system SHALL include rendering, interaction, and state management tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run efficiently in CI/CD pipelines, so that development workflow is not slowed down by testing bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL complete within 5 minutes for the full suite
2. WHEN test configuration is updated THEN it SHALL be compatible with both local development and CI environments
3. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested fixes
4. WHEN running tests locally THEN developers SHALL have access to watch mode and selective test execution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated error fixing for common test issues, so that I can focus on writing business logic instead of debugging test configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically fix module resolution and ES module issues
2. WHEN DOM mocking issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate jsdom setup and polyfills
3. WHEN import/export errors occur THEN the system SHALL fix TypeScript and ES module compatibility issues
4. WHEN async testing issues occur THEN the system SHALL properly handle promises and async operations in tests
